# Final Project: Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) Tool

## Project Overview
In this final project, you will develop a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) tool that helps analyze and visualize the environmental impacts of products or processes throughout their entire life cycle. This project will integrate Python programming fundamentals, data science concepts, and environmental science principles.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Apply Python programming concepts to solve real-world environmental problems
- Implement data analysis and visualization techniques
- Develop a practical tool with real-world applications
- Practice software engineering principles
- Gain experience in environmental impact assessment

## Project Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality
Your LCA tool must include:

#### Data Input System
- A system to input product/process data including:
  - Material inputs
  - Energy consumption
  - Transportation data
  - Waste generation
  - End-of-life scenarios
- Input validation and error handling
- Support for multiple data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)

#### Impact Calculation Engine
- Implementation of basic LCA calculations:
  - Carbon footprint
  - Water usage
  - Energy consumption
  - Waste generation
- Support for different impact categories
- Unit conversion and normalization

#### Data Visualization Dashboard
- Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn:
  - Impact category breakdowns
  - Life cycle stage comparisons
  - Trend analysis
  - Comparative analysis between alternatives
- Exportable reports and charts

#### Comparison Tools
- Side-by-side comparison of different scenarios
- Baseline vs. alternative analysis
- Sensitivity analysis
- What-if scenario modeling

### 2. Technical Requirements

#### Python Programming
- Proper use of data structures (lists, dictionaries, pandas DataFrames)
- Implementation of control flow statements
- Error handling and input validation
- Modular code organization with functions and classes
- Documentation and comments

#### Data Science Implementation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis
- Time series analysis where applicable
- Data visualization
- Export/import functionality

### 3. Project Structure
Your project should be organized as follows:
```
